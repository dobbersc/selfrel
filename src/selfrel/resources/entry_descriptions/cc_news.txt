This script annotates the CC-News dataset with named entities and exports each article with its annotations in the CoNLL-U Plus format.

We use a restricted version of Huggingface of the original CC-News dataset.
It contains 708241 English news articles published between January 2017 and December 2019.

Each processed article is assigned an article ID, starting at 1, based on the (deterministic) index in the dataset and written to 'cc-news.conllup'.

The following metadata is included in each sentence:
    - article_id (The article ID of the sentence's origin article.)
    - sentence_id (The sentence ID in the current article, starting at 1.)
    - text (The original text of the sentence.)

Note that article ID and sentence ID combined serve as a unique identifier for each sentence.

The following columns are included in each sentence:
    - ID
    - FORM
    - NER:FLAIR
    - NER_SCORE:FLAIR
    - MISC
