description: >-
  This sweep evaluates the best configuration from previous sweeps on multiple seeds
  for the self-training algorithm (3 iterations)
  and prediction confidence selection strategy on 1% training data of the CoNLL04 corpus.
  Since we use precomputed annotated support datasets and relation overviews from the initial model with seed 42,
  the model with seed 42 is the baseline to compare.
